This work is part of the White Rabbit project at CERN (cern.ch).

The package includes the raw I/O driver and the GN4124 driver. The kernel
part lives in the kernel/ subdir of the package, while user-space utilities
are under user/

Documentation is under doc/ and is written in Texinfo, which though
old is simple enough to require little efforts on my side. Output is
pdf, text and info.

To compile, just "make". If you miss TeX or texinfo you won't have the
docs.  If you miss the compiler or gmake you won't have anything.

To make clean just "make clean".
